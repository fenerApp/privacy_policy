<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
<p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
<p>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a 'sale'/'sharing' (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section '<a href="#number12">DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</a>'</p>
<p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
<h2>Google Analytics</h2>

<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

<h2 id="number8">8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="number9">9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
<h2 id="number10">10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p>In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section '<a href="#number15">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below.</p>
<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080">Member State data protection authority</a>or<a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/">UK data protection authority</a>.</p>
<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/en">Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a>.</p>
<h4 id="withdrawingConsent"><strong>Withdrawing your consent</strong>: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section '<a href="#number15">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below.</h4>
<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
<p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications</strong>: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by or by contacting us using the details provided in the section '<a href="#number15">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2>Account Information</h2>
<p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at fenerapp.er@gmail.com.</p>
<h2 id="number11">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="number12">12. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: <em>If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, lowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information.
